# For Your Eyes Only, Luv
Welcome, daring tinkerer, to "For Your Eyes Only, Luv," your steampunk-flavored steganography contraption! Hide secrets in images like a Victorian spy and decode them with the precision of a clockwork genius. If the gears jam, don’t blame us—just stoke the boiler and try again!

# Overview
This single-file HTML tool lets you encode secret messages into images and decode them later, all with a steampunk aesthetic (brass, gears, and a mechanical heart logo).

Download the encoded image (schematic, if you will).
Upload another image to decode the hidden message.
Steampunk UI with neon brass accents, rotating logos, and witty error messages.
